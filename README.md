# Java_OOP_Composition_Concept_SmartKitchen_Project
I built this program to practice with the Java OOP concenpt of Composition. 
The SmartKitchen parent class is composed of multiple sub classes, each representing a smart appliance. 
The user can instruct reach appliance when work needs to be done. At wich point, the appliance will perform it. 
This project does not contain a GUI.
